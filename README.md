# 🌟 Curly Bracket Scope Highlighter

🔍 A VS Code extension that highlights nested code scopes with a dynamic gradient overlay, enhancing code readability for JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C/C++, C#, Go. Now featuring:

- **Dynamic Gradient Highlighting:** The deeper the code nesting, the lighter the highlight becomes.
- **Enhanced Dictionary & JSON Separation:** Visually distinguishes nested dictionaries and JSON objects for clearer data structure visualization.
- **Improved Visual Orientation:** Helps you quickly orient yourself in deeply nested code blocks by using gradient highlights.
